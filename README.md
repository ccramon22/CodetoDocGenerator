# AI Group Project (ParameterPilots)

A project for fine-tuning language models to generate documentation for Python code.

## Project Overview

This project aims to train a language model to automatically generate documentation for Python functions. It includes:
- Data collection from popular Python repositories
- Preprocessing of Python code and docstrings
- Model training and fine-tuning
- Evaluation of generated documentation

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for training)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/33AndrewM33/ParameterPilots.git
cd ParameterPilots
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/MacOS
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to train the model and generate documentation:
```bash
python main.py
```

The script will:
- Clone Python repositories
- Extract function-docstring pairs
- Train the documentation generation model
- Evaluate the model on test cases

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main script for running the entire pipeline
- `data_collection.py`: Functions for cloning and processing repositories
- `preprocessing.py`: Code for extracting and preparing function-docstring pairs
- `model.py`: Model training and fine-tuning implementation
- `evaluation.py`: Functions for evaluating model performance
- `analytics.py`: Analytics and performance tracking
- `data/`: Directory for storing processed datasets
- `github_repos/`: Directory for cloned repositories
- `training_results/`: Directory for storing model checkpoints and results
